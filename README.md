[Whistler](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Whistler), also called Xeno, was the astromech droid of Corran Horn.
It was the same R-series model as the legendary R2-D2.

_Whistler is based on the [slackbot](https://github.com/trinchan/slackbot) library. He's pretty cool._

Restarting Whistler
-------------------
You may want to get comfortable with `hk log` and `hk restart` if you're having issues.
